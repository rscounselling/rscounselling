Hi everyone, my name is Reni Sharma. I am an enthusiastic and motivated individual who is passionate about supporting you to overcome barriers and achieve your life’s goals.

I currently hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and Criminology and am completing my Postgraduate Diploma in Counselling. My Counselling approach aims to utilise genuineness, respect, empathy to help support you with your problems and alleviate you from symptoms of psychological and mental distress. This is by integrating multiple disciplines and methodology in my practise such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Solution Focused Therapy and Person-Centred Therapy.

I focus on creating a trusting and supportive environment for clients. As a facilitator, listener and mentor, I aim to hold a safe space and offer guidance and support for individuals who face challenges in various areas such as anxiety, relationship issues, life transitions, stress management, parenting issues, divorce/separation, grief as well as empowerment and life coaching to help you move in the direction you  envision for your  life.

One of many achievements I have accomplished involved me undertaking a Mental Health placement in Sri Lanka, where I was given the opportunity to achieve an award for the “Best Mental Health Worker”. This involved using specialized methodology, tools and approaches to help clients seek out a holistic approach to balance the mind, heart and physical being through the intelligent combination of modern science and hands-on healing.
With my previous experience, complemented by my dedication to providing critical assistance to vulnerable individuals in need, I am committed to deliver the best person-tailored therapy which is tailored to suit your needs.
