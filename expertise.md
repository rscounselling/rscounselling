## Counselling for Expats

Being an ex-pat in Singapore myself, I understand some of the challenges and barriers a person may face when moving to a new country.  It can be both an exciting and a stressful experience, some of my personal challenges involved getting to know a different culture and society, facing a language barrier, having social fears, facing isolation and loneliness, unemployment, financial difficulties and many more. These may be a few of the difficulties faced by expatriates when going through this transition.

As a Counsellor, I aim to work with individuals to help support any challenges and to facilitate both cultural adjustment and help people manage these changes. I work with individuals on a 1-2-1 basis and understand that every individual requires a different approach and different amount of time for therapy.

## Career Counselling

Another area I specialise in is providing career counselling to individuals who may need support with choosing, changing, or leaving a career. For many people, their career is one of the most important aspects of their lives, therefore ensuring that they are satisfied with the career they are is an essential part of their well-being. I understand that this may be a stressful time and as a career Counsellor, I try and support you as much as possible by outlining and discussing potential career options.

## Mental Health
 
I am aware that mental illnesses have become very common these days, this may be due to work pressures, the current COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing relationship difficulties, unemployment, exam stress and many more. Some of these issues may involve feeling depressed, isolated, anxious, having OCD, Bipolar disorder and many more. My aim is to help you deal with these anxieties in order to lead a healthier and balanced lifestyle. This is by integrating a person-centred, non-judgemental and friendly approach in order to ensure you are able to express your concerns openly and receive the best support possible

## Relationship Counselling

People often go through many struggles and difficulties in their relationships or married life, they may end up disputing often, raging out to their partners or even being a victim of violence. This can result in an individual having a mental breakdown, finding it hard to cope with their daily life tasks and consequently having a negative effect towards everything else around them such as their family, friends, work and health.
