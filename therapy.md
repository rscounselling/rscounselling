# Counselling


Counselling is a confidential and professional relationship formed between the therapist and the client, It can help you to become aware of what your goals are in life and how you can achieve these. Exploring your thoughts and feelings with a professional counsellor can help you distinguish what is important for you in your life. It may help strengthen your self-esteem and help you to feel mentally stronger to achieve what you want in life. 

Counselling usually involves around 12 sessions or less, however this depends on every clientâ€™s situation and problems, as some individuals may require a longer amount of time for support. 

My therapeutic support for individuals entails providing support to people with various issues, some of these may involve undergoing:

- Trauma,
- Marital/couple/partner issues
- Relationship issues/breakdown
- Divorce
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Stress
- Phobias
- Low self esteem
- Gender identity
- Family issues
- Grief
- Addictions
- Financial issues
- Work conflicts

I offer a range of different therapies to help support individuals, depending on the individual, the therapies offered consist of CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy), PCT (Person-Centred Therapy) and SFBT (Solution Focused Brief Therapy).

# Methods

## Face-to-face sessions

I provide individual face-to-face Counselling sessions to help support individuals facing life challenges and develop new ways of resolving/coping with these issues. The face-to-face Counselling will be located in a safe and private environment, where confidentiality is kept at all times and a therapeutic alliance can be built between the Counsellor and the client.

Some of the benefits of face-to-face Counselling would be that Counsellors can observe your non-verbal communication (for example, the expressions on your face, the way you are sitting) to get a deeper understanding of what you are saying. Also, it enables the Counsellor to communicate more effectively with the client thus developing an enhanced therapeutic relationship.

## E-counselling

Where meeting and interacting face-to-face is not easily accessible for clients, I provide an option of e-Counselling, where support is given to clients based on an online Counselling service. E-Counselling is known in becoming more popular around the world and can be viewed as a more convenient, accessible, time-saving and private form of therapy enabling individuals to receive support at the comfort of their own home. I also provide the option for a video session through a Watsapp video call or Zoom as another option for clients.

## Phone Counselling
 
Offering therapy from the comfort of your own home, office or any other place, simply by using your phone. The advantage of phone counselling is that it may save you both time and money from not having to commute to and from appointments, provides you with an added level of anonymity and gives you the opportunity to gain support straightaway.
