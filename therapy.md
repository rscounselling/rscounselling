I offer a range of different therapies to help support individuals, depending on the individual, the therapies offered consist of CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy), PCT (Person-Centred Therapy) and SFBT (Solution Focused Brief Therapy).

## Face-to-face sessions

I provide individual face-to-face Counselling sessions to help support individuals facing life challenges and develop new ways of resolving/coping with these issues. The face-to-face Counselling will be located in a safe and private environment, where confidentiality is kept at all times and a therapeutic alliance can be built between the Counsellor and the client.

## E-counselling

Where meeting and interacting face-to-face is not easily accessible for clients, I provide an option of E-Counselling, where support is given to clients based on an online Counselling service. I also provide the option for a video session through a Watsapp video call or Zoom as another option for clients.

## Phone Counselling
 
Offering therapy from the comfort of your own home, office or any other place, simply by using your phone. The advantage of phone counselling is that it may save you both time and money from not having to commute to and from appointments, provides you with an added level of anonymity and gives you the opportunity to gain support straightaway.

The Counselling contact line is +65 84385770, you are able to message me during my working hours from Monday-Friday from the hours of 9 am -7 pm to arrange an appointment, or alternatively email me on renika629@hotmail.com, Iâ€™m excited about starting this new journey together.
