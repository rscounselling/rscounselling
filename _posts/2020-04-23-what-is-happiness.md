## What is Happiness?

Some may say this is a ‘silly’ question, others may be intrigued to find out what the scientific definition is. The true question is can you really define happiness? And if you can, then what does this truly mean?
 
Some people feel that happiness for them is going out shopping and spending money on their favourite items, some feel it through eating their favourite meals, being with their loved ones and taking part in their favourite interests and hobbies. Whereas, others may gain happiness through giving, meditating, listening to their favourite music/podcast or simply by having a cup of tea.
 
It is fair to say that everyone has a different perception to happiness and what may be a reason for someone to feel happiness does not mean that is the ultimate definition. My personal belief is that whatever makes you feel ‘happy’ is your own personalised definition of happiness.
 
For some, it may be difficult to define happiness but if you are able to think of the last time you felt happy and reflect on this time, ask yourself, ‘What was it about that experience that made you feel happy? Were there any people within your happiness state/ what was the environment like, what sounds did you hear?’ All of these factors may help contribute to your definition of what happiness is.
 
Another thought about today’s society is that there are so many distractions which involve people spending money limitlessly, such as on video games, clothes, gadgets, the question is if this is truly making them happy? Or is it that we have learnt that one cannot be happy without materialistic items?
 
This is a thought to leave you with.
