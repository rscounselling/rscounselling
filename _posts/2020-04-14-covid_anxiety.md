Usually, if I wake up sneezing or feel fatigued, I tell myself I am fine, I feel like this because it’s still early in the day and I will feel fine once I have completed my prayers and eaten breakfast. However, recently I have started to notice every little thing which could be a possible symptom of COVID-19 and find myself starting to panic if I think it may be the slightest symptom.

Are you able to relate to this? How can you distinguish your normal behaviors, (which you never really realised before), to whether you have a symptom of COVID without being officially tested?
 
This may be a frustration amongst many of us which we experience quite often.
 
This leads me on to discuss my recent experiences where I’ve experienced having ‘a shortness of breath’ and breathing difficulties. Now, the first thought I had was that this could be COVID, and that I need to see a doctor, IMMEDIATELY. Hastily, I went to my local surgery to see a doctor about this, who advised me to have an X-ray of my chest to see if they could see any infection on my lungs. Fortunately, my X-ray showed that my lungs were clear, but the Doctor informed me that if my breathing difficulties persist by the next day, I should take a trip to the A & E.

Although I was happy the scan showed my lungs were functioning fine; with myself being a constant worrier; I started questioning why I was having these breathing difficulties and why the Doctor would refer me to A&E if the symptoms persist. Surely there is something wrong with me, (these were the thoughts that kept recurring in my head, not that I wanted there to be!). I suffered from a terrible night of breathing difficulties and negative thoughts constantly disturbing my mind. My husband was extremely worried and the following morning we found ourselves sitting in the A&E pre-testing ward for symptoms of Coronavirus.

Whilst we waited patiently, we observed the nurse and support staff and I said a short prayer in my head to thank them a million times for saving people’s lives on a daily basis.
The doctor ran several tests only to tell me what I had previously heard the day before-that I was in good health, my temperature was optimal, I had no cough, my lungs were clear.
 
He then asked me if I have been worrying a lot recently because of this virus and I revealed that this was correct. He stated that my breathing difficulties may be a form of feeling anxious/worried and reassured me that it is normal to feel like this, and many patients have had similar visits due to feeling anxious about catching COVID-19.

I breathed with relief and apologised for taking his time up, I automatically felt better knowing I was fine, and as though my breathing had returned back to normal. Reflecting on this now, I can relate to how it feels to be anxious about symptoms which may make you believe you have COVID-19 but are due to stress and anxiety.

Undertaking breathing exercises on a daily basis has helped me to feel calm and relaxed as well as taking other precautions, e.g. staying home as much as possible, exercising and eating healthily and practising mindfulness. On a final note, for those who have had or have current similar experiences, it's okay to feel stressed and anxious about this epidemic, my advice would be to relax, find hobbies or interests, or engage in something you have wanted to do for a long time, to keep yourself busy and free from worrying…
