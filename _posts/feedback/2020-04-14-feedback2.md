feedback: "Reni is a kind and warm-hearted Counsellor who really understands the challenges and problems I am facing, even though there are so many. She took her time to listen to me, asked me questions about how I feel, no one has ever really listened to me as she did. I didn’t really want a solution, just someone to listen to me, and she gave me exactly that. Thank you!"
