feedback: "In today's world with all the different kinds of stress that we face both in our personal and professional lives, it becomes important for each one of us to know how best to tackle it and not let it overpower the peace of our minds and impact our lives and those of our loved ones. I have struggled with panic attacks in the past due to some upheavals in my personal life – & though I had developed my own way of dealing with it – it’s always good to counsel someone who has a better grip and understanding of the matter. I have consulted a few people in this field and most of them instead of listening to you end up directly trying to reach a solution (in some cases using medicines). When I took counseling sessions from Reni the first thing I noticed was how good of a listener she was and how she lets you ease out and speak your mind first before she helped with getting a written plan in place which included meditation, physical exercises and conscious effort to develop a hobby. I would highly recommend her to everyone!"
