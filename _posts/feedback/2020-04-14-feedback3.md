feedback: "The first time in my life I ever took a Counselling session and I’m happy to have Reni as my support line when I needed it so much. She fostered a safe and trusting environment and displayed warmth towards me. She listened to me effectively, understood things from my point of view and accepted what I said without judging me. She focussed on what was important to me and trying to discuss out the possible ways that can bring me out of this turmoil. God Bless Her!"
