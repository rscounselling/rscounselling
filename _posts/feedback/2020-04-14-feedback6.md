feedback: "Although I felt extremely stressed out about being unemployed, not having a career as well as having various family struggles, the counseling sessions I had with Reni have helped me to develop goals and strategies to overcome these problems. One of the best takeaways from the sessions is that I learned that it is about taking a small step at a time. She taught me techniques of relaxation and helped me to figure out what kind of career I really wanted. She was always positive, reaffirming and never judged me. I would definitely recommend her to anyone who wants Counselling. "
